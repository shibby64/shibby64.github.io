  "body": "React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become a fundamental part of React development. In this post, we will explore the most commonly used hooks: useState, useEffect, and custom hooks. We'll also discuss how to manage side effects and lifecycle methods using these hooks.
